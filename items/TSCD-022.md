# Title
Race conditions in contract origination & initialization

## Description
For example due to gas constraints bigger smart contract solutions may be deployed in multiple steps. This could lead to a vulnerability in case there third parties are able to interact with the parts already deployed and thus set an undesired state before all parts have been deployed and correctly initialized.

## Remediation
It is recommended to carefully design and plan the contract deployment and initialization.
