# Title
Unused variables and code 

## Description
Unused variables and code may indicate wrong programming logic. In addition to increasing storage and transaction fees, dead or unreachable code unnecessarily increases the attack surface, this is specially the case, if the code is an entrypoint.

## Remediation
It is recommended to remove all unused variables and code elements from the code.
